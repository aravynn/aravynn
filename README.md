Hi, I'm Kevin Jones, a developer from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada interested in C++ and web development programming.
This is my repository of work both completed and incomplete, and includes works built in C++, PHP, and Javascript. 

My training began first as a web designer and digital media specialist, which over the last 10 or so years has been 
migrating over to more and more application development due to the needs of my current employer, as well as my own 
interest in moving towards a more programming oriented role. I am a fully capable in working on both Mac 
and Windows environments, and currently develop applications for windows using Win32 as well as QT.

I'm currently studying to move into development of Machine Learning algorithms as well as procedural generation, I 
know a good deal of the math behind the algorithms, and should have samples of some programs up soon. 

I can be contacted via my email at aravynn at gmail.com
